 ATM Simulator – Java Project

The ATM Simulator is a Java-based application designed to mimic basic functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine. It allows users to securely access their accounts, check balances, withdraw or deposit cash, and exit the session—all through a simple command-line interface. The project showcases practical application of object-oriented programming principles and simulates real-world banking logic.
